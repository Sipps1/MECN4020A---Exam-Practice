        "A": "IV furosemide and oxygen therapy",
        "B": "Oral digoxin and bed rest",
        "C": "Cardiac catheterization",
        "D": "Intra-aortic balloon pump"
      },
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The initial management of acute decompensated heart failure focuses on symptom relief with diuresis (IV furosemide) and oxygen therapy to improve oxygenation. More invasive interventions are reserved for specific cases.",

        "D": "Oral glucose tolerance test"
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Islet cell antibodies are specific markers for autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, confirming type 1 diabetes. Other options diagnose diabetes but don't differentiate between types.",
